# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System

This project is a **Face Recognition-Based Attendance System** that automates the process of marking attendance. Using facial recognition technology, the system identifies registered users and records their attendance in real-time, making the process more efficient and secure.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Uses a pre-trained model to detect faces in real-time.
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces against a stored database of users.
- **Attendance Recording**: Automatically marks attendance for recognized faces with timestamps.
- **User Management**: Add, update, and delete user details in the system.
- **Report Generation**: Export attendance records for a specific date range in CSV format.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)

- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV for face detection and recognition
  - dlib for facial landmark detection
  - NumPy for data manipulation
  - Flask for backend API development

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AryanDaksh/Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System.git
